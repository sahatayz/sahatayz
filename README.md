## 👋 About Me

I'm a mathematics graduate with hands-on experience in software automation, currently focusing on **smart contract security**.
I enjoy reasoning about correctness, identifying edge cases, and translating complex systems into minimal, testable models.

- 🔍 Focus: **Solidity security & auditing**
- 🧪 Tooling: **Hardhat / Foundry** (unit tests, coverage, fuzzing & invariants in progress)
- 🧩 Background: real-world automation and product-oriented development
- 📍 Istanbul, TR

> “Clarity → correctness → calm execution.”

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Smart contract vulnerabilities (access control, reentrancy, unsafe calls)
- DeFi mechanics & risk (oracles, incentives, edge cases)
- Test-driven security (unit tests → fuzzing → invariants)
- Writing clear findings, minimal PoCs, and actionable fixes
